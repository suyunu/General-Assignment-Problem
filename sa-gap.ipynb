    "# Simulated Annealing on General Assignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we tried to solve General Assignment Problem (GAP) with Simulated Annealing (SA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Assignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost. Moreover, each agent has a budget and the sum of the costs of tasks assigned to it cannot exceed this budget. It is required to find an assignment in which all agents do not exceed their budget and total cost of the assignment is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the solution, I used a simple list structure. Cells of the list are jobs and numbers in the cells are the agents assigned to that job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example solution representation:\n",
    "[7, 1, 0, 4, 4, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 4, 0, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 7, 6, 6, 7, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We used simulated annealing with some modification to solve General Assignment Problem. First, I will write the pseudocode of my simulated annealing and then try to explain important parts like neighborhood structure and stopping condition.\n",

    "#### First Solution Generation (generateSolution())\n",
    "\n",
    "This step generates the first solution for the algorithm. For the reason that SA is an improvement heuristic, we should generate an initial solution. I will explain it with the pseuodo code:\n",

So, after trying lots of combinations and taking notes on them, I actaully got very confused and decided to make a automated system which will run the code several times with different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I determined some values for each parameter and run the code 5 times for each adjustment for each dataset. After each run I took objective values, %Gap values, number of cycles and run times for statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran the hyperparameter optimization on dataset 2. It actually was going to take more than 8 hours to complete, so to avoid this situation, when we encounter a configuration which gives worse than 2% gap in any run then we discard this configuration. With this method, it took nearly 3 hours to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it took so long to complete, I ran the code in two parts, first one for 2-change move operator and second one for 3-change move operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Important Note: It takes too long to run the optimization part. Because of that, I saved the output of the optimization parts into two files. You can load them via the code below the optimization part. **"
